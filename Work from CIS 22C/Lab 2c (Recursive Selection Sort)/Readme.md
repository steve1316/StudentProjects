Write a template Array class that can accept any type of numeric data, character data or string data.  The array should be dynamically created based on size entered by the user.

Then write the code for either a recursive bubble sort or recursive selection sort algorithm in a function of its own - to sort the data in the descending order.

In your interactive main, ask the user for the number of data items and the type of data items to be entered.  You can limit the types of data to 'int', 'double', 'char' and 'string'.  Then get that many data items from the user - you can expect that the user will not make any error in entering the data items.  Finally sort the data in descending order using your sort function and print the how the array looks at the end of every sort step.

Just names and birthdays as data attributes are sufficient.
Implement your BST as a link-based ADT - you should be able to reuse your LinkedList and Node classes from Labs 2 and 2b.
For the data, create a text file of data in a random fashion - one data entry per line.
Read the data to create your BST for the database by name or birthday as needed.
Write out the listing of everyone by name to a file (separate from your input) using a post-order traversal mechanism.
Write out the listing of everyone by birthday to a different file using a breadth-first traversal mechanism.
Include your code source tree, input text file and the two output files in your zip upload. Only one file upload is allowed.
Ensure I can run the programs by changing the data in your files without having to fix your code for file locations.

Write a program that maintains a database containing data, such as name and birthday, about your friends and
relatives. You should be able to enter, remove, modify, or search this data. Initially, you can assume that the
names are unique. The program should be able to save the data in a file for use later.
	Design a class to represent the database and another class to represent the people. Use a binary search tree
of people as a data member of the database class.
	You can enhance this problem by adding an operation that lists everyone who satisfies a given criterion.
For example, you could list people born in a given month. You should be able to list everyone in the
database.
